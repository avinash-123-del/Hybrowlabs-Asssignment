React-Vite ProjectOverviewThis project consists of two main functionalities:
Character Frequency Counter:
Given any string, the program calculates the frequency of each character while maintaining the original sequence.
Ignores whitespace.
Optimized for performance.
Star Wars API Integration:
Clicking the "Add Record" button fetches a random Star Wars character from the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/api/people/{random number}).
The fetched character's details (name, height, mass, gender) are displayed in a table.
Each record has a "Delete" button to remove it from the table.
Uses Axios for API calls.
